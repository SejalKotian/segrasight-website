    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Hospitals generate enormous volumes of biomedical waste every day — from
      contaminated plastics and sharps to infectious materials. A single large
      hospital can produce several tons of waste daily, much of which must be
      segregated correctly at the point of disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, waste segregation is manual, error-prone, and time-constrained.
      Studies estimate that a significant fraction of hospital waste is
      misclassified, leading to contaminated recycling streams, increased
      treatment costs, and serious safety risks for healthcare and sanitation
      workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulatory penalties for improper biomedical waste disposal can reach
      thousands of dollars per violation, in addition to long-term compliance
      risks, audits, and reputational damage for healthcare facilities.

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
      SegraSight builds intelligent waste terminals powered by AI and
      hyperspectral imaging to enable accurate, error-free biomedical waste
      disposal in hospital environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      By identifying waste materials in real time and guiding correct disposal,
      SegraSight reduces misclassification, improves compliance, and lowers
      operational and regulatory costs for healthcare facilities.
