      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Hospitals generate enormous volumes of biomedical waste every day — from contaminated plastics and sharps
        to infectious materials. A single large hospital can produce several tons of waste daily, and correct
        segregation is required at the point of disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, segregation is manual, time-constrained, and error-prone. Misclassification can contaminate
        recycling streams, increase treatment costs (e.g., treating general waste as regulated medical waste),
        and create serious safety risks for healthcare and sanitation workers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improper disposal can also trigger audits, operational disruptions, and regulatory penalties that can
        reach thousands of dollars per violation depending on jurisdiction and severity — plus reputational risk.
